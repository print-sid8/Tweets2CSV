## Hi

This code gives anywhere between 500 to 5000 tweets depending on how popular the hashatg is.

It will be saved in an CSV file with labels that you defined, at your C:/Users/"user-name" folder.

In the present format, without any edits to the code, it will give you the text of the tweet, along with, time, date, tweeter's follower count, all the hashtags present, location, geo coordinates(if available), type of device used to tweet, retweet count, and favorite count.

This can be run multiple times in a day, and usually gives tweets ranging from about 3-4 hours prior to the start of your stream, till about 3 days back.

Unfortunately, Twitter's official policy gives only 1% of the actual twitter stream, hence if you run the code twice, almost immediately, you will get the same tweets again.

So, the best way to coved a lot of tweets is to run the code every half hour, or every one hour.

I hope this is useful for anyone looking to gather tweets in an accessible format.
Thank you
